# FLYNC Library


## Description
FLYNC (FLexible Yaml-based Network Configuration), an open-source, repository-native solution that turns vehicle network configuration into clean, version-controlled code.

The heart of FLYNC is a single, human-readable model schema together with a comprehensive SDK that lets you create, validate, and manipulate configurations programmatically.

By organizing system definitions in a central, version-controlled repository, this tool helps engineering teams manage complexity, enable reuse, and maintain consistency across domains.


## Key Features


### 🧩 Layered Configuration Validation
Purpose-built for automotive networks, the language models configurations across multiple abstraction layers, enabling early detection of inconsistencies and integration issues.


### ⚙️ Configuration-as-Code Paradigm
Bring modern software engineering practices to configuration management:

- **Git-based version** control and workflows
- **CI/CD pipeline integration** for automated validation
- **Traceability and reproducibility** across releases


### 🚀 Fast and Reliable Engine
Highly optimized validation and parsing logic allow the library to handle large-scale configurations with **high and predictable** performance.


### 👩‍💻 Developer-Friendly Design
Designed for usability and rapid adoption:

- Intuitive, readable syntax
- Clear and structured documentation
- Suitable for **domain experts, software & network engineers**


### 🌍 Open Source & Collaborative
Released under an open license to encourage:

- Community contributions
- Ecosystem integrations
